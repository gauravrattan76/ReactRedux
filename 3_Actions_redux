Actions-


The only way we can interact with the store

Carry info from your app to store


Plain javascript objects

They have a type property indicating the type of action being performed

The type property is defined as string constants


____________________________________________________

We also have action creator - a function that returns a action


First is we declare string constants-

const BUY_CAKE = "BUY_CAKE";



Then action creation - object with type and some info

  {
        type: BUY_CAKE,
        info:'this is the first action'
    }


We wrap the action in function - that is called action creators - function that returns actions

function buyCake(){
    return {
        type: BUY_CAKE,
        info:'this is the first action'
    }
}
