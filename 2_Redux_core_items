3 core concepts in react

1. Store-  holds The state of your application
2. Action- describes the changes in state of application 
3. Reducer - carries out state transition depending upon the action


Rules-

1. The state of your app is stored in a single object tree with in a single store
2. The only way to changes state is to emit a action, an object describing what has happened


You can’t directly state object
State is ready only, only way to changes is via action 


3. To specify how state tree us transformed by actions we write pure reducers

Reducer takes initial state and action and returns new state


Pure reducer -are pure functions


Instead of updating previous state, returns new state

Javascript app —  component dispatches the action —— actions calls to reducers —— reducer returns new state —— passed to component
